This baby project looks at a product dataset.

The goal is to explore the data and understand basic patterns like ratings

and how many products each brand has.



The dataset is from Kaggle about Sephora. The dataset contains information about products such as:

- Product name

- Brand name

- Customer ratings

- Number of reviews and engagement



I used a Jupyter Notebook to:

-Load and explore the data

-Create simple summaries statistics

- Produce simple charts to visualize ratings and brands
